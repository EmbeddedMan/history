// prior 1
// =======
// change pic32 to use uart2 for serial.c (#define UART_NUMBER)
// move block.c and fat32.c from pict-o-crypt to sources (include in skeleton)
// have usb host mode append to file on boot, rather than truncate.
// on/off/mask/unmask should move to parse2.c/run2.c
// 9s12 and others need to reset timer counter when increasing frequency output -- see "wrap"
// add qspi pin assignments to online help (data, clk, cs)
// ";" at end of print statement to supress crlf?
// "input" BASIC statement?
// Ctrl-E to dump all variables while basic program is running?

// doc
// ===
// change VBUS to +5V in schematic
// add digital input and analog output example
// add minimum flash requirements for pic32 and 5225x to mcu details
// document "conflicting timer usage"
// remove 52221 examples from help reference section

// prior 2
// =======
// saw bug changing pic32 pin from servo to freq mode on fly?
// add demokit skeleton
// attempt to decouple servo pwm from frequency -- 256 should be 2.56ms independent of Hz!
//   9s12 and cfv2 can do 4 16 bit channels!
// i2c support
// spi-to-sd card data logging
// how to enable different uart selection (other than lowest number) for console?
// gets warnings
// permanent params (protected from upgrade) for nodeid, ipaddress, etc.
// zigbee read remote variables
// we need a way to prevent you from upgrading the wrong firmware file!!!
// change ftdi to cdc and use mst for inf file access
// if data area of flash looks bogus on boot, we should clear it all!
// have nodeid and clusterid, and broadcast 0x4242 and clusterid as magic number
// save zigbee channel in nvparam!
// need a second catalog page for safe updates!
// add character constants 'c', '\n'; do we want a way to print in character form?
// add strings
// optionally restore usb serial number in eeprom from sources/ftdi.c v1.53 to make com port number persistent?

// prior 3
// =======
// PC/Cell framework!!!
// add mst interface for basic progs and fw access
// add zigbee support thru xbee for ubw32?
// prompt on|off|ok
// get rid of remaining SPL_USB, SPL_IRQ4, etc.
// get rid of rtc isr remap on jm/qe
// if dhcp not found on 33, assign random ip compatible with windows?
// why mcf52xxx dtim freq not off by 2x?
// figure out usb "pop" on first badge run -- is that the badge issue?

// prior 4
// =======
// can we make sub/endsub block behave more like for/next, from error and listing perspective?
// expose mass storage interface with access to basic programs (and firmware upgrade?)
// allow broadcast/remote nodeid setting (with switch), like pagers
// builtin operators -- lengthof(a) or a#
// short circuit && and || operators
// add ability to configure multiple I/O pins at once, and assign/read them in binary (or with arrays?)
// multiple (main) threads?
// "on usb [connect|disconnect]" statement for slave mode!
// ?: operator!
// add support for comments at the end of lines '?  //?
// switch statement (on xxx goto...?)
// allow gosub from command line?
// sub stack trace?  (with sub local vars?)
// one line "if <expression> then <statement> [else <statement>]"
// optional "let" statement
// sleeps and timers don't work with single-stepping
// should we attempt to make rx transfers never time out/clear feature?
// core dump -- copy ram to secondary code flash on assert/exception/halt?
// handle uart errors (interrupt as well as poll)

// perf
// ====
// mave var one slot towards "last in gosub scope" on usage rand()%16?
// can we skip statement execution more fully when run_condition is false?

// pcb
// ===
// battery holder
// pin offset for headers
// smt power switch and reset switch
// all diffs in PCBUNDO
// tp for pstclk
// Fill a bunch of copper to the U1 heat sink pad -- both sides would be helpful
// Break the solder mask below U1 to allow for it to better dissipate heat.
// U2 heat sinking as well?
