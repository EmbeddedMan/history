// prior 1
// =======
// why does jm upgrade show diff cecksum (by 0x5a?) than program from cw?
// multi-pin variables (digital I/O only)!!!
// I should probably allow "as byte" or "as word" on pin variables, but I don't currently.
// pasting into an edited line doesn't work!  echo buffer overflow!
// add getchar example in ug?
// generate skeleton with HIDBL commented out!
// make flash filesystem allocate only as much space as is needed to save a current program!
// mode to disable usb device (and autorun disable to override)
// move block.c and fat32.c from pict-o-crypt to sources (include in skeleton)
// on/off/mask/unmask should move to parse2.c/run2.c
// 9s12 and others need to reset timer counter when increasing frequency output -- see "wrap"
// add qspi pin assignments to online help (data, clk, cs)
// Ctrl-E to dump all variables while basic program is running?
// add a faster zigflea option for pic32/5225x!

// doc
// ===
// change VBUS to +5V in schematic
// add digital input and analog output example
// add minimum flash requirements for pic32 and 5225x to mcu details
// document "conflicting timer usage"
// MCU details says "autorun disable", but we are inconsistent in docs with use of "safemode*"

// prior 2
// =======
// fgure out a clean way for spi/i2c to steal pins
// expose erase_page and write_word to basic to manipulate other half of flash!
// allow input of negative numbers
// give vprint ability to do sign extension?
// add ability to configure multiple I/O pins at once, and assign/read them in binary (or with arrays?)
// add configurable file name for usb host mode
// consider doing servos in sw w/ lightweight isr rather than using hw timers
// add "modes" to turn off USB and QSPI and get their pins back for gpio
// saw bug changing pic32 pin from servo to freq mode on fly?
// add demokit skeleton
// attempt to decouple servo pwm from frequency -- 256 should be 2.56ms independent of Hz!
//   9s12 and cfv2 can do 4 16 bit channels!
// spi-to-sd card data logging
// how to enable different uart selection (other than lowest number) for console?
// gets warnings
// permanent params (protected from upgrade) for nodeid, ipaddress, etc.
// zigbee read remote variables
// we need a way to prevent you from upgrading the wrong firmware file!!!
// if data area of flash looks bogus on boot, we should clear it all!
// have nodeid and clusterid, and broadcast 0x4242 and clusterid as magic number
// save zigbee channel in nvparam!
// need a second catalog page for safe updates!
// handle uart errors (interrupt as well as poll)

// prior 3
// =======
// PC/Cell framework!!!
// add mst interface for basic progs and fw access, also inf file access
// add zigbee support thru xbee for ubw32?
// prompt on|off|ok
// get rid of remaining SPL_USB, SPL_IRQ4, etc.
// get rid of rtc isr remap on jm/qe
// if dhcp not found on 33, assign random ip compatible with windows?
// figure out usb "pop" on first badge run -- is that the badge issue?

// prior 4
// =======
// can we make sub/endsub block behave more like for/next, from error and listing perspective?
// allow broadcast/remote nodeid setting (with switch), like pagers
// short circuit && and || operators
// multiple (main) threads?
// "on usb [connect|disconnect]" statement for slave mode!
// ?: operator!
// add support for comments at the end of lines '?  //?
// switch statement (on xxx goto...?)
// allow gosub from command line?
// sub stack trace?  (with sub local vars?)
// one line "if <expression> then <statement> [else <statement>]"
// optional "let" statement
// sleeps and timers don't work with single-stepping
// core dump -- copy ram to secondary code flash on assert/exception/halt?

// v2.0
// ====
// generic programmable i2c/spi/uart/ethernet/cdc (host and device) gateway
// make console virtual uart a first class citizen!!!
// separate os from stickos; allow non 50/50 flash split
// allow basic isrs to run while waiting for uart or i2c receive data (anywhere we allow ctrl-c)

// perf
// ====
// mave var one slot towards "last in gosub scope" on usage rand()%16?
// can we skip statement execution more fully when run_condition is false?

// pcb
// ===
// battery holder
// pin offset for headers
// smt power switch and reset switch
// all diffs in PCBUNDO
// tp for pstclk
// Fill a bunch of copper to the U1 heat sink pad -- both sides would be helpful
// Break the solder mask below U1 to allow for it to better dissipate heat.
// U2 heat sinking as well?
